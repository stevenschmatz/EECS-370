#### Communication

How do we communicate? Language. We have a common protocol to communicate. Computer languages like C serve the same purpose â€“ to connect humans and computers.

The CPU understands binary (0 and 1), so `gcc` or `g++` converts your C code to a binary executable.

#### Binary Representation

* Two's complement notation
    * Most widely used notation for binary numbers
* Example
    * `int x = 5`. The real storage in the computer is `00000101`, since `int`s are allocated 8 bits.
